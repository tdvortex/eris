# Launch a server

Once you have a domain name, a Discord application ID, and a public key, you're ready to start configuring your instance.

However, there are different ways you can choose to deploy Eris, depending on your budget and intended scale. Eris is designed to be flexible and performant at a variety of sizes, but the two that work out of the box are **Monolith** and **Serverless**.

Note: in the following descriptions, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) is used as an example provider, because they are a large and well-known cloud services provider that supports all of the features Eris is configured to use. Other providers offer similar services as well, and you should choose your provider carefully.
