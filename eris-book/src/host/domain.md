# Register a domain

To run an instance, you'll need a unique domain. This will be the second half of all of the handles on your instance, the "@site.tld" part of "@username@site.tld".

You will need to lease your name from a registar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). This comes with a yearly fee, which costs more or less depending on the name you choose.
