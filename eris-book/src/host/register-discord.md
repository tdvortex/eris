# Register with Discord

Once you have your domain, then you need to register your application with Discord on their [Developers portal](https://discord.com/developers). 

Give your bot some basic information:
* Name
* Icon
* Description
* Up to five tags

Also, take note of your "Application ID" (also called your Client Secret), as well as your Public Key. You will need these during your app configuration page.

Do **not** put in your Interactions Endpoint URL yet. You need to have your instance set up and ready to receive a PING request before you can enter your new domain in here. That's the next step.
