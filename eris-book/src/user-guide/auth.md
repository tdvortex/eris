# Auth

"Auth" is an abbreviation for two similar, related, but slightly different terms: **authentication** and **authorization**.

* **Authentication** is proving that you are who you say you are.
* **Authorization** is proving that you are permitted to take a specific action.

These are related because you generally have to be authenticated before you can be authorized above a minimum level.
