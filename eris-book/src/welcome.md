# Welcome to the Eris book!

**Eris** is an open-source bridge between [Discord](https://discord.com) and the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), the ecosystem of social networks using the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol, including [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), and more.

In the simplest use case, Eris is a forwarding service that will send a feed of followed posts from other apps into one or more Discord channels of your choice, and will post Discord messages of your choice to your followers on other Fediverse networks.

But, under the hood, it is a fully-fledged social network in its own right, and offers a variety of ways to interact with it.

The name refers to [Eris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(mythology)), the Greek goddess of strife and discord. 

This book is a guided tour of Eris's features and use, to help users, hosts, and other developers learn how to get started.
