# Welcome to the Eris book!

**Eris** is an open-source bridge between [Discord](https://discord.com) and the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), the ecosystem of social networks using the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocol, including [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), and more.

You can think of Eris as a forwarding service that will send a feed of followed posts from other apps into one or more Discord channels of your choice, and will post Discord messages of your choice to your followers. But, under the hood, it is a fully-fledged social network in its own right, and offers a variety of ways to interact with it.

This book is a guided tour of Eris's features and use, to help users, hosts, and other developers learn how to get started.
