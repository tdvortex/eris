# Core features

Eris is, essentially, a feed-based social network that uses Discord as its primary point of access. 

* Users post short-form text content with images/videos attached are posted by users, using Discord application commands
* Users can view one or more feeds filled with content of other users they follow, inside existing Discord channels

It's helpful to look at existing social networks to see where Eris is similar, and where it is different.
