# Feed-based vs Chat

Other social networks generally fall into one of two types: feed-based and chat.

## Feed-based

On most social networks, a user will publish some kind of content, and will receive a *feed* or timeline of content posted or re-shared by other users. This means that users are forming relationships with other users, usually with a "follows" or "subscribes" relation. 

Most of the differences are in what kinds of content are posted; one website might focus on short-form text uploads (like Twitter/X, Tumblr, or Mastodon), another might be a video sharing service (like Youtube, TikTok, or PeerTube), another might be audio uploads (like SoundCloud or Funkwhale).

Posts on most feed-based social networks are public by default; once posted, content can usually be seen by anyone who has a link to that content. 

Users can usually show their approval of content by "liking" it, and optionally "sharing" (also called "resharing", "reblogging", "boosting", or other terms), which is handled as if the user had posted it themselves, but attributes it to the correct original user.

There is usually also a "direct message" system or its or equivalent for private user-to-user communication.

Feed-based apps generally update quickly in response to new posts or activity by other users, but are not real-time.

## Chat

Discord, meanwhile, is more like a traditional group chat service (like WhatsApp, Telegram, or WeChat). Chat rooms are organized into what Discord calls "servers" or sometimes "guilds", with each server/guild having many channels. Users can also directly message each other if they are friends.

Users can join a server and (depending on permissions) view and post in these shared chat channels. On Discord, a message always is private to a specific channel, and access privileges are controlled by the admins of that server/guild.

Discord messages are posted in real-time on a scrolling feed. A larger Discord community server can often be extremely fast-moving, with a channel seeing many users chatting simultaenously. But, because chat messages last forever, a smaller or slower-moving server might behave more like a forum board, with larger posts at a lower frequency.

## Other structures

Of course, other systems are possible. There are few rules, mostly only guidelines. 

Reddit and Lemmy, for example, lets users post content to a subreddit/community, view its content, and vote or comment on it.
