# Concepts

Eris is a social network, but it's different from other social networks you may have used before. This section goes over some key concepts to understand about how Eris works.

* **Federation**: Eris is neither fully centralized, nor fully peer-to-peer, hybridizing the two with peer instances providing access to clients.
* **ActivityPub**: Eris uses the ActivityPub protocol to let different Eris instances share data with each other, and with other ActivityPub systems.
* **Features**: Eris provides users with a way to send messages out into the Fediverse, and to receive messages and display them on channels.
* **Objects** The "nouns" in Eris are: instance (Application), user (Person), channel (Service), post (Note), Image, Video, and message.
* **Activities**: The "verbs" in Eris are: Create, Update, Delete, Follow, Like, share (Announce), Block, and Undo.
